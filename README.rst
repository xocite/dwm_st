dwm_st
=======
My fork of st with a set of patches applied.

Changes
-------
* Change the cursor colour depending on the current text.
* Vertical centre lines within the line height.
* Disable bold colours.
* Remove gaps between st and other apps when the font size isn't perfectly matched with the window
  space.
* Use '-z' to set the font size.
* Read ~/.Xresources.
* Scroll up and down with ctrl-pgup and ctrl-pgdown.
